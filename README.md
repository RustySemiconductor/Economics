# Economics
Trying to create more or less realistic economics for Factorio

##Why do I need this?
I want to enrich gameplay in Factorio, especially midgame and lategame stages. Biter massacre and rocket building are good, but I want to add new goal - to create successful company and conquer the market. Even if you are not into this kind of stuff, market can be helpful. Don't want to spend your time messing around with blue science or have oil shortage, but have giant iron deposit inside your walls? Constant biter attacks depleted your ammo, walls and turret reserves, but you have ten steel chests of speed modules? Sell excess supply and eliminate shortage.
I know about GalacticTrade mod, but it seems abandoned. I also want to practice my Lua coding skills, so I decided to create this mod from scratch.

##Planned features:
- Advanced economic model (No more "buy from Elysium / sell to Oblivion", except if you want it). Prices will be affected by supply and demand. If you instantly fill market with tons of copper ore, its price will drop beyond production cost.
- Dynamic market. Supply and demand will change over time. Market with big copper surplus from example above will attract copper plate manufacturers. If you stop producing copper ore, they will have shortages and copper ore price will increase, resulting in creation of new copper ore providers.
- Reputation and interaction. Player will be a part of market, not its centre.

##TODO:
- [x] Add basic chests (similar to vanilla smart chest).
- [ ] Add logistic chests (similar to vanilla logistic chests).
- [ ] Integrate price tables into base game
- [ ] Create link between chests and market
